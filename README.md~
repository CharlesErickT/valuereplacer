Value Replacer

This is a little python script for Linux/Mac that will search a file and replace de value of a variable

The syntax should be the following: 
[1] Is the name of the file'
[2] Is the variable to look for'
[3] Is the separator between the variable and the value'
[4] Is the new value
Example: apple.txt value1 = 1

This will search the file test.txt for value=something and change it to value=1
You can specify the separator / : , or anything you like

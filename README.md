Value Replacer

This is a little python script for Linux/Mac that will search a file and replace de value of a variable
 <br />
The syntax should be the following:  <br />
[1] Is the name of the file <br />
[2] Is the variable to look for <br />
[3] Is the separator between the variable and the value' <br />
[4] Is the new value <br />
Example: test.txt apple = 1 <br />
 <br />
This will search the file test.txt for value=something and change it to value=1 <br />
You can specify the separator / : , or anything you like <br />
